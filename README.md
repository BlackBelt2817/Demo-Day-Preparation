# Lambda School Demo Day Presentation Requirements

### Video requirements:
* 3-4 minutes.
* Approved by Lambda Staff by 4:00PM PST day prior to demo day.

### Recommendations
* Introduce the product, or your portion of the presentation with a live recording of yourself, then transition to the demo.
* Record and edit using  [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/). The trial works fine. You’ll send the project to a Lambda Staff member who will do the final export.
* Make sure your app has plenty of appropriate, professional, sample data.
* Plan on doing multiple takes to avoid one-off bugs or other potential issues.
* Act and sound appropriately excited about what you’ve built. Not over the top, but don’t sound bored. You built something cool!

The video should be tightly edited and polished. Your tone and demeanor should be professional. Find a quiet room with a clean backdrop for quality video and audio. If you don’t have access to space, check your local library, college, or any coworking spaces. They often have private rooms you can use.

Do not show your code. Focus first on the product, second on the tech stack, third on how you overcame specific technical challenges. This is a first impression, not a technical interview. Polish and professionalism are paramount. 

### Sample video script:

**Student 1**
> Hi. My name is [full name]

**Students 2-3 or 4**
> I’m [full name]

**Student 4 or 5**
> And I’m [full name]

**Student 1**
> Together we built [Project Name], a simple app for [one sentence description of what the app does].

**Student 2**
> We decided to build [Project Name] because [two or three sentence description of what motivated you to build the project].

**Student 3**
> We built the project using [description of tech stack], and we followed a [product management style] flow to coordinate our group efforts.

**Student 4**
> As we demo the project, you’ll see why we used [tech stack], and how we divided the work.

**Student 1-5**
> One of my major responsibilities on the project was [description of feature or other responsibility]. 

_Demo feature, describing how it contributes to the user experience, why it’s important to the project, etc._

> One of the challenges I ran into while building this feature was [one or two sentence description of the challenge, and one or two sentences on how you addressed or solved the problem].
> 
> With more time, I would continue to improve this part of the project by [one to three sentences how you’d improve the part you’re talking about].

**Student 1**
> Well! That's our project. Thank you for taking the time to watch our demo.

### Personal Projects
While the focus of Demo Day is primarily on group capstone projects, we have time to feature high quality individual projects. These may be things you built in your own time, during the hackathon, or otherwise contributed to while at Lambda School.

If you want your personal project to be featured, you may submit a 90 second video following the structure above for capstone projects.

### Submitting Your Video
If you want your project featured at Demo Day, you’ll need to submit it to Lambda Staff prior to demo day. If you need Lambda Staff to export your ScreenFlow video, please submit it at least 24 hours before the event.

We’ll post a submission form for videos early next week.
